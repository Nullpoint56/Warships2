# Plans Index

## Active Plans

- `docs/plans/active/config_system_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/active/wgpu_only_renderer_migration_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/active/wgpu_renderer_functional_completion_plan.md`
- Diagnostics execution plan remains under diagnostics:
  - `docs/diagnostics/implementation/engine_debug_tools_implementation_plan.md`

## Archived Plans

Moved historical plans:

- `docs/plans/archive/engine_test_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/warships_test_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/quality_ci_enablement_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/rendering_mode_migration_plan.md`
- `docs/plans/archive/rendering_resize_resolution_plan.md`

## Lifecycle Rules

1. New actionable plans go into `docs/plans/active/` unless they are diagnostics-specific, in which case they go into `docs/diagnostics/implementation/`.
2. Completed/superseded plans move to `docs/plans/archive/`.
3. Every archive move must be summarized in `docs/history/development_history.md`.
